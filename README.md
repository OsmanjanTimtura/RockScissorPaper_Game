# This is Rock-Scissor-Paper Game
I developed this game a while ago, and made some edits before uploading it on my new github.
People can play against each other or against the program. 
Player needs to enter player name before playing.
Player also needs to choose the opponent before the game. 
If player chooses to play with another player, user input is hidden.
And when player chooses to play against the program, user's selection is visible.
